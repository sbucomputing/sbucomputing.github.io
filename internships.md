# Internships

## Requirements

- The student works under the supervision of a computing professional in an industrial (non-academic) setting.
- The student's project(s) must be related to their program's curriculum.
- The position must require the student to be intellectually active.

❌ For example, internships that are primarily comprised of data entry or deploying identically imaged computers do not meet the above requirements.

✅ Projects that would meet the above requirements might involve designing or modifying a database, designing or maintaining code, network configuration/management, or active web-page development.

## During the Internship

- The student must keep a daily or weekly journal of the experience and their hours. This will be handed in upon completion of the internship.

- At the end of the internship, the student must have a supervisor write a letter to a faculty member describing the work accomplished by the student along with an evaluation of the student’s performance.

## After the Internship

-	The student is required to write a paper (approximately 10 pages) describing the internship experience and reflecting on the experience and its relation to courses the student has taken at SBU. This paper should cover the following:
    1. A title or cover page with your name, class, date and the name of the organization/company
    2. A table of contents
    3. Background information on the company
    4. Describe your position and responsibilities in the internship
    5. Discuss what you learned and the skills you developed
    6. Any other information you feel appropriate
    7. How this experience will help you in your career
    8. Conclusions

-	The student is required to give a talk to students and faculty describing the internship experience. The talk should be no more than 10 minutes, and cover at least items (iv) and (v) above. You may also wish to explain how these items relate to courses you've taken at SBU.

## Required Hours

Typically the internship will involve full time employment for one summer, though students can break up the completion of their internship requirement across multiple semesters if they would like. Students must complete a total of 3 credits to graduate.

Credits are assigned as follows:
- 3 credits → minimum of 300 hours
- 2 credits → minimum of 200 hours
- 1 credit → minimum of 100 hours

## Finding an Internship

It is the student’s responsibility to secure the internship position, which is why students are encouraged to begin searching and applying for internships in their second year. Students should consider the following sources of potential internships:

- Job listings faculty hear about, sometimes via alumni in the [community channels](community.md)
- Your personal LinkedIn network you've been building over the years
- Your friends and family - make them aware you're looking for an internship and see what opportunities they know of
- The [Career & Professional Readiness Center](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/academic-resources/career-professional-readiness-center) on campus, especially [Handshake](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/academic-resources/career-professional-readiness-center/CPRC-Services-for-Students/internship-and-job-resources)
- Online job sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Monster

## Faculty Internship Coordinators

Your internship should be approved by a faculty internship coordinator *before* you complete it. Once approved, the coordinator will register you in the appropriate number of credits, and track the items that you must submit.
