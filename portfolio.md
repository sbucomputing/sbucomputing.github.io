# Portfolio

The recomended approach for creating your portfolio is to use [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) since it is free, professional, and relatively easy to use. You should update your portfolio as you progress through your major to showcase your class projects, skills, and accomplishments. This is perfect for job applications, internships, and grad school.
