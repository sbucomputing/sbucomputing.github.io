# Capstone
A senior comprehensive/capstone project is required of Computer Science and Data Science majors. 

## Requirements
* Work under the supervision of one or more faculty members
* Carry out a project that draws upon content from multiple courses, including outside of the major
* Generate either new research or a new technology, as demonstrated by a literature review
* Submit all of the required documents described below

## Timeline

### Getting Registered
- Prior to their senior year, students should propose a general idea to the faculty member that they'd like to be their mentor
- If the mentor approves of the idea, the student should:
	- Email Dr. Bopp and CC their faculty mentor
	- Indicate the general topic
	- Indicate that the student has discussed the idea with the faculty mentor and that they have OK'd their mentorship of the project

### First Semester
* Conduct a literature review
* Agree on a scope with the faculty member in a written proposal
* Carry out the project as described
* Update the faculty member mentor at least weekly using an agreed upon method
	* Goals for the week
	* Progress from the prior week
	* Challenges encountered
	* Any questions

### Second Semester
- Complete project
- Share results with the community through the required documents below
- Share results with the community through a 15-minute presentation that gives an overview of the project and what was found

## Required Documents

### Project Proposal
1. Introduction
2. Description of at least 10 relevant academic articles
3. Detailed description of what you will do in your project
4. Brief description of how you believe your work may contribute new knowledge to the field (grounded in the above academic articles)
5. Brief description of courses drawn upon within and outside of the major
6. Weekly timeline for completing the project

### Final Paper
A 10-15 single spaced final paper in an [ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or IEEE standard template which contains:
1. Introduction
2. Related Research
3. Methodology
4. Findings
5. Discussion
6. Conclusion
7. Citations
